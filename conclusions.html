    <h1>Conclusions and Outlook</h1>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>First of all, we (the project team) would like to thank the INSPIRE community for the incredible amount of support and input that you provided! You supported us as members of the Expert and Advisory Board, through filling out the survey, or through encouraging us to go forward. Based on this input, we see this work to be highly relevant.</p>

    <p>From the <a href="/survey.html">survey</a> we quickly learned that there is a real need to define an extension methodology, even among the mostly expert audience that provided responses. On the implementation side, the main challenges lie with system integration and data harmonisation.</p>

    <h2>Outlook</h2>

    <p>There are still a lot of open questions about additional patterns. We see some emerging that would be highly useful, such as Redefine, but the tooling is not complete enough to recommend their usage. We could continue to develop the tools we used to analyse model extensions, and there are more than 20 more model extensions out there that we haven't yet published. We plan to continue this work, so please continue to <a href="/introduction.html#contributions">submit contributions</a>!</p>
